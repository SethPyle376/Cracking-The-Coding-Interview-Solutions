# Cracking the Coding Interview Solutions

These are my solutions to the problems presented in the book Cracking the Coding Interview by Gayle Laakmann McDowell

Each chapter of problems has a corresponding Java class (for example the "Recursion" class corresponds to chapter 8 in the book).
Contained in the class are methods implementing solutions for the problems in that chapter.

Each class then has a set of tests to validate the solutions to each problem.

## Automated Tests

A Github action runs the tests on PR's to main as well as any commits to main.
